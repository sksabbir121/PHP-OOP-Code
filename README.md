1.Valid Parentheses :

This program checks whether a given string of parentheses is valid or not. The program uses a while loop to maintain the balance of parentheses.The program prompts the user to enter a string of parentheses. After inputting the string, the program will output whether the parentheses are valid or not.

Algorithm:
The algorithm uses a while loop to check for valid parentheses. It checks each character in the input string. If an opening parenthesis is encountered. Then it checks for closing parenthesis. If the closing parenthesis is found then it is a valid parenthesis or it is not a valid parenthesis.




2.Inheritance:
Inheritance in OOP is a mechanism by which a new class called a subclass is created based on a superclass or base class. The subclass inherits attributes and methods from the superclass, allowing it to reuse code and extend the functionality of the superclass.

'cir ' class
Represents a circle shape.

construct($radius): Constructor to initialize the circle with a given radius.
area(): Calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.

'rect' class
Represents a rectangle shape.

construct($width, $height): The constructor initializes the rectangle with given width and height.
area(): Calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.




3.Encapsulation:

Encapsulation in OOP is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. Encapsulation allows for the hiding of the internal state of an object and restricting direct access to it from outside the class.

construct($name,$salary): Constructor to initialize the employee with the given name and salary.
getName(): Retrieves the name of the employee.
getSalary(): Retrieves the salary of the employee.
setSalary($salary): Sets the salary of the employee. Ensures that the salary is a non-negative number.
